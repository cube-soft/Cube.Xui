Cube.Xui is a library to support the MVVM pattern in WPF applications.
The library is available for .NET Framework 3.5, 4.5, .NET Core 3.0, or later.
Note that basic functionality for the MVVM pattern is implemented in the [Cube.Core](https://github.com/cube-soft/Cube.Core), and the WinForms part is in the [Cube.Forms](https://github.com/cube-soft/Cube.Forms).

## Installation

You can install the library through the NuGet package.
Add a dependency in your project file using the following syntax:

    <ItemGroup>
        <PackageReference Include="Cube.Xui" Version="2.1.0" />
    </ItemGroup>

Or select it from the NuGet packages UI on Visual Studio.

## Dependencies

Cube.Xui depends on the [Microsoft Expression Blend SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/ja-jp/download/details.aspx?id=10801).
Note that we will migrate to the [Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Xaml.Behaviors.Wpf/) in the future, which is the [OSS project](https://github.com/Microsoft/XamlBehaviorsWpf) of the Expression Blend SDK.
